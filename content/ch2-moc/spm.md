The Random Access Machine (RAM) model of computation is a theoretical framework developed to analyze algorithms and computational efficiency. Introduced in the mid-20th century, the RAM model was devised to bridge the gap between high-level algorithmic analysis and the hardware implementation of computing systems. It simplifies the architecture of a physical computer into an idealized system that supports a sequential execution of instructions, allowing for the study of computational complexity independent of hardware idiosyncrasies.

The RAM model emulates the basic operation of the Turing machine using the following key components:

 1. An infinite sequence of memory cells, each capable of storing arbitrary-length integers
 2. A finite set of instructions that operate on these registers
 3. A program counter that keeps track of the current instruction
 4. An accumulator register for arithmetic operations

The infinite sequence of cells is equivalent to the infinite Turing Machine tape, and the program counter is a more capable representation of tape movement.
A key inspiration for the RAM model of computation came from the von Neumann architecture, which was conceptualized by John von Neumann in the late 1940s. The von Neumann architecture's hallmark feature is the stored-program concept, where instructions and data are stored in the same memory. The von-Neumann machine, later
renamed to the Stored Program Machine had a profound impact on the design and development of modern computers, enabling programmability and flexibility.

**Basic Operating Principle**

After loading a program into the main memory of the Stored Program Machine,
the Operating System writes the address of the entry point of the program
into the Instruction Pointer (IP) register of the processor. After that initialization,
a Stored Program Machine uses the following resource contention management mechanism
to unabiguously execute a program:

 1. fetch an instruction from the address pointed to by the IP register, and update IP to point to the next instruction
 2. decode instruction
 3. dispatch to appropriate execution units
 4. execute
    * if execute unit is the load/store unit then request data from a memory location or provide data to store at memory location
    * if execute unit is branch unit then load IP with new address
    * else execute address/branch/arithmetic/logic/function operation
 5. store result of execute unit in a register

This cycle is repeated till a halt instruction is executed, or an interrupt is issued.
 
**Success and Impact**

The RAM model, particularly through its stored-program realization, has had a profound influence on both theoretical computer science and practical engineering. It serves as the foundation for algorithm analysis, underpinning complexity classes like **P** and **NP**. By providing a clear and manageable abstraction, it has guided the development of efficient algorithms and hardware architectures.

In practice, Stored Program Machines revolutionized computing by enabling the development of versatile, programmable systems. From early mainframes to modern microprocessors, this organization remains central to computer technology. The ubiquity of stored-program principles in nearly all contemporary digital devices is evidence of its success.

The RAM model, and its Stored Program Machine incarnation, represents a crucial bridge between theoretical computer science and practical computing systems. Its enduring success lies in its ability to balance mathematical abstraction with practical relevance, making it an invaluable tool for education, research, and system design. As computing continues to evolve, the principles embodied in the RAM model remain fundamental to our understanding of computation and algorithm analysis.

While highly successful, the abstractions underlying the basic operation are progressively more difficult to attain when implementation technologies miniaturize.
It is obvious that no physical machine can offer infinite memory cells, and this complication lead very early on to the design of memory hierarchies to 
provide a practical solution. The constraints created by the memory hierarchy required significant alteration of the core algorithms to yield reasonable
performance. And as chip process technology entered the 90nm regime, the energy consumed by the control infrastructure and memory hierarchy
became dominant. This is favoring micro-architectures that amortize more arithmetic density per instruction. However, the energy inefficiency of the Stored Program Machine is limiting, and new machine organizations are required to continue to improve computational density. The following sections will introduce two specific
improvements to support concurrency and improve energy efficiency beyond what the Stored Program Machine can offer.
