A model of computation is a model which describes how an
output of a mathematical function is computed given an
input. These models describe how units of computation,
memories, and information (data) exchanges are organized.
The benefits provided by a model of computation is the
measure of the computational complexity of an algorithm
independent of any specific physical implementation.

There are sequential models of computation:
1. Finite State Machines (FSM)
2. Pushdown automata
3. Turing machines
4. Decision Tree Models
5. Random Access Machine

And parallel models of computation:
1. Cellular Automata (CA)
2. Kahn Process Networks
3. Petri Nets
4. Synchronous Data Flow

In this chapter, we'll provide a summary of the Stored Program Machine, which provides an implementation of the Random Access Machine model of computation, and the Data Flow Machine, an implementation of the Synchronous Data Flow model of computation.

And we'll introduce the new Domain Flow Architecture (DFA), which
solves the problem of diminishing returns when trying to scale 
up the Data Flow Machine.
