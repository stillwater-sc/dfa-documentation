In this short introduction to parallel algorithms in general and domain flow 
in particular, our next step is to look at specific algorithms, and explore
their optimal parallel execution dynamics.

Once we get a good collection of fast, and energy efficient algorithms together,
we can start to explore how best to engineer combinations of these operators. 
We will discover that sometimes, the cost of an information exchange makes 
a whole class of algorithms unattractive for parallel executions. With that
insight comes the need to create new algorithms and sometimes completely new
mathematical approaches to properly leverage the available resources.
