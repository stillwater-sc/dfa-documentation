Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines are an historically significant set of
functions that encapsulate the basic building blocks of a large collection
of linear algebra algorithms and implementation.

The BLAS library has proven to be a very productive mechanism to create and disseminate highly optimized
numerical libraries to a plethora of computer architectures and machines. Writing high-performance linear
algebra algorithms turns out to be a tenacious problem, but since linear algebra operations are essential  
components in computational methods, the investment can pay high dividends.
