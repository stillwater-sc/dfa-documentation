BLAS Level 3 are {{< math >}}$\mathcal{O}(N^3)${{< /math >}} operators, and finally compute bound 
creating many opportunities to optimize operand reuse.

In addition to matrix-matrix multiply there are the Rank-k update operators, which are outer-products
and matrix additions.

Here is a Hermitian Rank-k update:

{{< math >}}$$ C = \alpha A A^T + \beta C, \space where \space C \space is \space Hermitian. $${{< /math >}}

A Hermitian matrix is defined as a matrix that is equal to its Hermitian conjugate. In other words, 
the matrix {{< math >}}$C${{< /math >}} is Hermitian if and only if {{< math >}}$C = C^H${{< /math >}}. Obviously a Hermitian 
matrix must be square. Hermitian matrices can be understood as the complex extension of real 
_symmetric_ matrices.

# Matrix-matrix multiply

We have seen this algorithm in the introduction:

```

compute ( (i,j,k) | 1 <= i,j,k <= N ) {
    a: a[i,j-1,k]
    b: b[i-1,j,k]
    c: c[i,j,k-1] + a[i,j-1,k] * b[i-1,j,k]
}
    
```

# Hermitian Rank-k update

Starting from a single matrix, generating the transpose is a very expensive operator. 
For simplicity, let's start
with the computational phase {{< math >}}$\alpha A A^T${{< /math >}}.

```

compute ( (i,j,k) | 1 <= i,j,k <= N ) {
    a: a[i,j-1,k]
    at: at[i-1,j,k]
    if k = 1 {
        c: beta[i,j,k-1] * c[i,j,k-1] + a[i,j-1,k] * b[i-1,j,k]
    } else {
        c: c[i,j,k-1] + a[i,j-1,k] * b[i-1,j,k]
    }
}
    
```

Here we introduce a conditional constraint that impacts the domain of computation for a set of equations.
