# Domain Flow Algorithms

Domain Flow algorithms are parallel algorithms that incorporate the constraints of space and time.
By honoring the delay that is inherent to exchanging information between two spatially
separate computation or storage sites, domain flow algorithms can improve performance and energy efficiency
compared to sequential programming models that depend on (globally addressable) random access memory.

High-performance, low-latency, energy-efficient computation is particularly important for the emerging application
class of autonomous intelligent systems.
