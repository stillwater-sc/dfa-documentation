This makes these operators operand access limited and thus require careful distribution in a parallel environment.
There are four basic vector operations, and a fifth convenience operators. Let $ \alpha \in \Bbb{R}, x \in \Bbb{R^n}, y \in \Bbb{R^n}$ then:
scalar-vector multiplication: $z = \alpha x \space (z_i = \alpha x_i)$ vector addition: $z = x + y \space (z_i = x_i + y_i)$ dot product: $c = x^Ty \space ( c = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i ) $, aka inner-product vector multiply: $z = x .</description></item><item><title>BLAS Level 2</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/blas/level2/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 07:55:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/blas/level2/index.html</guid><description>BLAS Level 2 are $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ class operators, typically still very much operand access limited as we need to fetch multiple operands per operation without any reuse. The core operator is the matrix-vector multiplication in all its different forms specialized for matrix shape, such as triangular, banded, symmetric, and matrix type integer, real, complex, conjugate, or Hermitian.
Let $A \in \Bbb{R^{mxn}}$, the matrix-vector product is defined as: $$z = Ax, \space where \space x \in \Bbb{R^n}$$</description></item><item><title>BLAS Level 3</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/blas/level3/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 07:55:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/blas/level3/index.html</guid><description>BLAS Level 3 are $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ operators, and finally compute bound creating many opportunities to optimize operand resuse.
In addition to matrix-matrix multiply there are the Rank-k update operators, which are outer products and matrix additions. Here is a Hermitian Rank-k update:
$$ C = \alpha A A^T + \beta C, \space where \space C \space is \space Hermitian. $$
A Hermitian matrix is defined as a matrix that is equal to its Hermitian conjugate.</description></item></channel></rss>
