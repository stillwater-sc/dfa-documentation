A Domain Flow program for this operator is shown below:
compute ( (i,j,k) | 1 &amp;lt;= i,j,k &amp;lt;= N ) { a: a[i,j-1,k] b: b[i-1,j,k] c: c[i,j,k-1] + a[i,j-1,k] * b[i-1,j,k] } The underlying algorithm requires a domain of computation governed by a set of constraints, and a set of computational dependencies that implicitly define a partial order across all the operations in the computation.</description></item><item><title>Digital Filtering</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/filters/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 16:57:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/filters/index.html</guid><description>Digital Filtering is the act of focusing a signal to key features for observation.</description></item><item><title>Identification</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/identification/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 16:58:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/identification/index.html</guid><description>Identification is the act of recognizing the signal in the presence of noise.
When there are signals and noises, physicists try to identify signals by modeling them, whereas statisticians oppositely try to model noise to identify signals. In this study, we applied the statisticians&amp;rsquo; concept of signal detection of physics data with small-size samples and high dimensions without modeling the signals. Most of the data in nature, whether noises or signals, are assumed to be generated by dynamical systems; thus, there is essentially no distinction between these generating processes.</description></item><item><title>Spectral Analysis</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/spectral/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 17:04:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/spectral/index.html</guid><description>Spectral Analysis analyses the frequency components of a signal.</description></item><item><title>Transforms</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/transforms/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 17:05:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/dsp/transforms/index.html</guid><description>Signal Transforms map the signal function to other functions for further analysis.</description></item></channel></rss>
