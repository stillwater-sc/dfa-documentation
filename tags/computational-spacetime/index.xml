Processing nodes are fixed in space, and information is exchanged between nodes to accomplish some transformation. Nodes consume and generate information, and communication links move information (program and data) between nodes. This leads to a simple abstraction of a physical parallel machine consisting of a fixed graph in space that constraints computation and communication events generated by the parallel algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Computational Spacetime</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/introduction/computational-spacetime/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 06:58:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/introduction/computational-spacetime/index.html</guid><description>Computational Spacetime Data movement in a parallel machine experiences the constraints of spacetime and more. The propagation delay in a communication channel acts similarly as the constraint on the speed of light in spacetime. Let&amp;rsquo;s bring back the mental model of a parallel machine being a fixed graph in space with communication channels connecting a set of nodes. The channels of communication constrain the propagation directions for information exchange. If we make the assumption that computation and communication are separate steps and that they can be overlapped to hide the latency of the communication phase, then we can leverage the mental model of spacetime to argue about partial orders of computational events that might be able to effect each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
