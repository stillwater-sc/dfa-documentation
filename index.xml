By honoring the delay that is inherent to exchanging information between two spatially separate computation or storage sites, domain flow algorithms can improve performance and energy efficiency compared to sequential programming models that depend on (globally addressable) random access memory.
High-performance, low-latency, energy-efficient computation is particularly important for the emerging application class of autonomous intelligent systems.</description></item><item><title>Elements of Good Design</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/design/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 07:42:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/design/index.html</guid><description>For sixty years, we have been optimizing for sequential computation. The best algorithms for sequential execution are those that minimize the number of operations to yield results. Computational complexity theory is well-aligned with this quest, but any performance-minded algorithm designer knows that the best theoretical algorithms are not necessarily the fastest when executed on real hardware. The difference is typically caused by the trade-off sequential algorithms have to make between computation and accessing memory.</description></item><item><title>Basic Linear Algebra</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/blas/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 07:54:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/blas/index.html</guid><description>Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines are an historically significant set of functions that encapsulate the basic building blocks of a large collection of linear algebra algorithms and implementation.
The BLAS library has proven to be a very productive mechanism to create and disseminate highly optimized numerical libraries to a plethora of computer architectures and machines. Writing high-performance linear algebra algorithms turns out to be a tenacious problem, but since linear algebra operations are essential</description></item><item><title>Matrix Factorization</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/factorization/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 07:54:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/factorization/index.html</guid><description>Matrix factorizations are the work horse of linear algebra applications.
