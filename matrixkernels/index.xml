Identifying singularity, and quantifying the null-space of a matrix are key operators before we can try to solve systems of equations.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 07:57:10 -0500</lastBuildDate><atom:link href="https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/matrixkernels/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Matrix Kernels</title><link>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/matrixkernels/matrixkernels/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 07:57:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stillwater-sc.github.io/domain-flow/matrixkernels/matrixkernels/index.html</guid><description>In mathematics, the kernel of a linear map, also known as the null space or nullspace, is the linear subspace of the domain of the map which is mapped to the zero vector. That is, given a linear map
$$L : V \rightarrow W$$ between two vector spaces $V$ and $W$, the kernel of
$L$ is the vector space of all elements $v$ of $V$ such that $L(v) = 0$, where 0 denotes the zero vector in $W, or more symbolically:</description></item></channel></rss>
