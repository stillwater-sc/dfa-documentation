Processing nodes are fixed in space, and information is exchanged between nodes to accomplish some transformation. Nodes consume and generate information, and communication links move information (program and data) between nodes. This leads to a simple abstraction of a physical parallel machine consisting of a fixed graph in space that constraints computation and communication events generated by the parallel algorithm.</description></item></channel></rss>
