When there are signals and noises, physicists try to identify signals by modeling them, whereas statisticians oppositely try to model noise to identify signals. In this study, we applied the statisticians&amp;rsquo; concept of signal detection of physics data with small-size samples and high dimensions without modeling the signals. Most of the data in nature, whether noises or signals, are assumed to be generated by dynamical systems; thus, there is essentially no distinction between these generating processes.</description></item></channel></rss>
